# DefinitelyTypedAuthorMention
A very simple page to help you get all the authors of a DefinitelyTyped package in github mentions `@username`. :fire:

## Why I made this page? :thinking:

The truth is I am very lazy. I wanted to mention all the authors of @types/mongoose to open an [issue](). I found [too many authors](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/tree/master/types/mongoose/index.d.ts). I decided to copy all the text and write a [simple python script](https://gist.github.com/kerolloz/c920ec811648c7265ff64ddfd3a087c8) :nerd_face: to extract them from the source code. Five minutes later I found myself writing a simple webpage to do that. üë®‚Äçüíª
